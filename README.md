# ATM - SIMULATOR

This is my first project as a beginner in C++, it simulats an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) using text based interactions.

The program has a 4 PIN code, the code is 1234
Once logged in, users can:

Check their balance
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Exit the ATM

The program includes simple input validation, looping menus, and basic arithmetic operations. I will further enhance this project within mastering the fundamentals in the future.
